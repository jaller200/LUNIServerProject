2.002 Fixed using domain names with clients<BR>
2.003 Removed feedback loop test code with RakVoice<BR>
2.01 Added ID_REMOTE_EXISTING_CONNECTION (client only).  This is sent to clients that have just connected to a server, one message per existing client on the network.  Also fixed a bug where static data was not sent to new clients from existing clients.<BR>
2.011 Specifying UNASSIGNED_PLAYER_ID for SendStaticData wasn't broadcasting when it should have been.<BR>
2.012 Fixed a case where ID_REMOTE_CONNECTION_LOST was reported incorrectly.  THe connection was not actually lost, just the report was wrong.<BR>

Cirilo Bernardo made the BitStream class and most tests endian complaint. Fixed handling ordered packets that arrived more than 2 out of order. Fixed formatting broken by a contributor. Fixed resend queue counting "Holes" towards the overall size, blocking sends if a single packet was lost with subsequent packets not lost.<BR>
2.401 Fixed contributor bug causing the first PlayerIndex to use an invalid value on the client.<BR>
2.402 Fixed a rare case where if a player disconnected and another player connected right away you could still read leftover packets from the disconnected player.<BR>
2.41 Order of magnitude performance improvement. Reduced memory requirement by about 25%. Added plugin system, with a fully connected mesh plugin. Fixed bug with not detecting duplicate packets when the packet counter wrapped.<BR>
2.411 Fixed lost connection being reported if no data sent by the user for 10 seconds.<BR>

Added automatic memory synchronization message handler.  Added class member RPC calls.  Added ability to pass data with Advertise System. Re-fixed memory leak in Array class. No longer include DemonBattle sample to cut down on download size.<BR>
2.418 Made changes so it would compile under DevCPP and hopefully Linux.<BR>
2.419 Replaced AES128.h/.cpp with Rijndael.h/Rijndael.cpp to hopefully be different-endian portable.  Updated NetworkIDGenerator so you can include it as a member object to generate IDs rather than inheritance.<BR>
2.42 Bunch of minor changes thanks to pinniped. Also a preliminary version of my data replication plugin.<BR>
2.43 Added PacketLogger plugin. Renamed MessageHandlerInterface PluginInterface. Renamed DataReplication DataReplicatorTest. Updated Doxygen documentation. Revamped DataReplicator plugin (work in progress).<BR>
2.431 Added HelloWorld video tutorial.  Revised DataReplication system to where it's stable enough to release without a warning.  Depreciated DistributedNetworkObject class and sample, which is now superceded by the DataReplication system.<BR>

Added Write and Read functions to bitstream for matrices, vectors, and quaternions. Added current time parameter to data replicator memory callback (because calling RakNet::GetTime is slow).<BR>
2.44 Added WriteDelta and WriteCompressedDelta to BitStream class.  Changed BitStream class to use template and template specialization for native types.  Bitstreams can now read and write PlayerIDs directly.  Added replyFromTarget parameter to RPC so you can now use RPC as a blocking function that takes a reply from a remote system.  Improved performance of SingleProducerConsumer class and fixed a small chance of overrun or underruns on multiprocessor systems. Improved documentation for DataReplicatorSystem. Clarified ObjectMemberRPC example.  Replaced critical section lock on incoming packet queue with a single producer consumer, improving read throughput rate by about 200%.<BR>
2.444 Updated all header file documentation for Doxygen.  Tweaks to the data replicator system.<BR>
2.45 Fix Linux compatibility.  Simplified data replicator by removing property flags. Increased size of OrderingIndexType to unsigned short so you can reorder more than 256 out-of-order ordered packets on the same channel at a time.  This fixes the rare bug report where ordered packets arrive out of order due to extreme send rates with high packetloss.<BR>
2.451 Fixed bug where dropped connections were not detected as long as you kept sending to the dropped system.  WriteVector, etc. in the BitStream class can now take doubles as well as floats.  Fixed an invalid assert when passing 0 to the fully connected mesh as the password.<BR>
2.452 Fixed not detecting dropped connections when only one packet was being resent.<BR>
2.453 Improve template compatibility.<BR>
2.454 Master server / Master client now uses Plugin interface. Fixed bug that appeared on Linux where out of older order packets were incorrectly treated as duplicate and dropped.  Same fix reduces memory usage by about 400 bytes per player. Reorganized packet resend loop to hopefully fix a reported infinite loop. Added define _COMPATIBILITY_1 to exclude compilation of code that uses alloca, FormatMessage, the security layer, gethostbyname, #include <windows.h>, and inet_ntoa.  This define also changes the default MTU to 1492. Updated documentation for memory synchronization of DataReplicator. Updated FAQ. Added OnDetatch to the PluginInterface.<BR>
2.455 Fixed many gcc warnings.  Fixed error where alloca wouldn't compile under Code::Blocks<BR>
2.456 Add channel parameter to functions RakPeer::Disconnect and RakPeer::CloseConnection. Added RakPeer::SetTimeoutTime and removed constant TIMEOUT_TIME. Optimized network thread playerID lookup from O(n) to O(log2(n)), which will improve directed send speeds when a server or peer has many connected systems. Added SetNetworkSimulator procedure so the network simulator can be activated, deactivated, and be adjusted by users at runtime.  Added checking for _FINAL define, to exclude code that would never be used in release builds.  Currently only applies to the NetworkSimulator<BR>
2.457 Fixed harmless assert on startup in ReliabilityLayer::SetPing. Fixed uninitialized variable read when sending ID_ADVERTISE_SYSTEM with no user data. Fixed search indexing bug in OrderedList causing performance loss. Increased DataReplicator memory registration limit from 255 to 65535.<BR>
2.46 Added IsObjectListPushComplete to the DataReplicator system.  The DataReplicator class factory now has access to the creation send and request data.  Added CommandConsoleServer and CommandConsoleClient. Padded single byte packets to 2 bytes to fix some router issues.<BR>
2.461 Exported most of the user classes, so if you are using a DLL you don't have to include the source. Added more functions to RakNetworkFactory to new and delete those classes. Fixed an assert in DataReplicator. Added const to StringCompressor::EncodeString and AdvertiseSystem. Fixed projects so they all build.<BR>
2.47 Released first iteration of ReplicaManager, which replaces DataReplicator, which I will no longer include in distributions.  Added ReplicaManagerCS and ReplicaManagerP2P samples.  Added missing *identifierFound=true in GetServerListRuleAsInt.  Added OnCloseConnection to PluginInterface. The NetworkID generator system now supports peer to peer. Added StringTable class.<BR>
2.48 Fixed critical bug where if an unreliable packet was lost all further data would be considered duplicate. In the ReplicaManager you can now use objects without calling construct first.  The BitStream class for VC6 reverts to the old BitStream that didn't use templates.  Renamed ObjectID NetworkID and renamed UNASSIGNED_OBJECT_ID UNASSIGNED_NETWORK_ID.<BR>
2.481 All changes to the ReplicaManager: Added ReferencePointer. Using a default scope of true will no longer trigger SendScopeChange and ReceiveScopeChange calls for that true default value. Functions now use the return type ReplicaReturnResult.  All 3 callbacks now include a ReplicaManager * to the manager. Fixed bug setting bitwise enumerations for commands for the ReplicaManager.<BR>
2.482 Removed mutex locks for incoming and outgoing password. Bug fixes for ReplicaManager. Added 64 bit time support.<BR>
2.483 (04/19/06) Replaced %8 with &7 in BitStream.cpp.  Thanks to Oliver Smith for pointing this out. Changed offline pings to be totally offline, rather than connecting and then disconnecting.  This might fix the reported bug with pinging and not being able to reconnect. Reordered packet enumerations so that the most commonly used ones are first.  Updated readme.txt.<BR>
2.484 (04/21/06) Fixed stack overflow problem when sending RPC packets with more data than the stack can hold (via define MAX_ALLOCA_STACK_ALLOCATION).  Added PlayerID::ToString(). Converted Bitstream constructor char *'s to unsigned char *'s so you can pass Packet::data to it without casting. Fixed memory leak if you disconnected with unread packets waiting (Thanks to "riley" and "Greg" in the forums).  Removed various warnings.  Updated Linux ChatExample (thanks to Oliver Stone for sending me the files).<BR>

Fixed memory leak if sending an RPC to a system that disconnected between the user call and the network thread doing the send. Removed maximum message size limit of (formerly) 91 megabytes, improved CPU efficiency of message reassembly, and decreased per-split bandwidth usage by 2 bytes. Fixed bug where you could get recursive RPC calls with blocking RPCs. Added _RAKNET_THREADSAFE to support multiple writer and reader threads using the same instance of RakPeer. BitStream.h should now compile on Visual Studio 2005.<BR>

Add clan support to lobby database (in progress). Fix RakString (was broken for lobby). Fix include paths for VC8 for speex. Many warnings removed for non-windows users. ReadyEvent system now supports going back to unready. Disabled sample PerformanceTest.<BR>
3.2 (4/15/08) NAT Punch through now uses duplex symmetric port prediction, resulting in a vastly higher success rate. Fixed a bug in SingleProducerConsumer resulting in a 12 byte memory leak per message sent or received in release. Thanks to cmusch in the forums for finding this.<BR>
3.21 (4/20/08) Reverted to speex-1.1.12 to fix broken voice activity detection. Turned on voice activity detection by default to fix a bug where the voice latency increases over time. Add "SuperFastHash" to speed up DirectoryDeltaTransfer and Autopatcher file scans by 30%. Add file RakThread for easier cross-platform thread creation.<BR>
3.22 (05/04/08) Fixed TTL send not working for NAT punch through. TCPInterface now has a nonblocking option for connections. Lobby system now takes the handle of a friend, not just ID, for friend operations, and returns the handle and ID used in the callbacks. BitStream class can now hold up to rangeof(unsigned int)/8 bytes. Fixed bug with connection sequence so FullyConnectedMesh should always complete connections. Fixed Packetlogger output. Added RakPeerInterface::SendLists(), used by FileListTransfer for better efficiency. Increase connection attempt failure time to 4 seconds so users with software firewalls have a chance to click accept. Fixed RakString::Replace. Fixed Table::GetAvailableRowId. Added PHPDirectoryServer project.<BR>
3.23 (05/11/08) Fix subtraction underflow caused by bad GetTime() values for ReliabilityLayer. This could cause reliable packets that were lost due to packetloss to never be resent. Added RakPeerInterface::IsLocalIP(). Fixed PostgreSQL implementation of autopatcher. Added MySQL implementation of autopatcher. Fixed SQL injection security holes with autopatcher server. Add TLS support to TCPInterface, allowing the EmailSender class to send through Gmail. Fixed infinite recursive call under DevCPP and MinGW caused by #define with stricmp<BR>
3.24 (06/16/08) Autopatcher: optimized MySQL queries, fixed file list transfer callback, improved Linux compatibility. ReplicaManager2: Added SEND_SERIALIZATION_CONSTRUCTION_TO_SYSTEM, fixed bug with sending scope changes. AutoRPC: Fixed passing a boolean as the last parameter. Fixed encoding error when doing directed sends. Fixed race condition in ThreadPool.h. NAT punchthrough will now try the local IP sooner. Return ID_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION when CloseConnection is called with sendDisconnectionNotification==false. Fixed parsing error when passing domain names to RakPeer::Connect(). PHPDirectoryServer will now update the correct row based on the system address key.
3.25 (07/27/08) Added RPC3 plugin and video. The second and later resends of reliable messages now occur one second apart (fixes flooding/disconnects at low pings). Added templated GET_OBJECT_FROM_ID to NetworkIDManager.h which will work with multiple inheritance when NetworkIDObject is not the firstmost derived class. Added char *firstDataChunk parameter to FileListTransferCBInterface::OnFileProgress callback. Fix FileListTransfer when doing endian swapping. Fixes for Linux FileOperations.cpp and FindFirst (fixes autopatcher). ReplicaManager2: Added GetTimeToNextAutoSerialize, fix timestamp endian swapping, multiple instances now supported on the same instance of RakPeerInterface (must use AutoAddConnections(false)). Added static SocketLayer::IsPortInUse(). Virtual function and multiple inheritance fixes for AutoRPC.  Various fixes and updates for PHPDirectoryServer. Change GetExternalID(UNASSIGNED_SYSTEM_ADDRESS) so that it returns a consistent external address. Add boolean parameter includeDisconnecting to RakPeerInterface::IsConnected(). RakPeerInterface::CloseConnection() now cancels connection attempts in progress immediately and reliably. Ready event fixes. Add operator << and operator >> to Bitstream. BitStream now supports Read functions for other bitstreams.
