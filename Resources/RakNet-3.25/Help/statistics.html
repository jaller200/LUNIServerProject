  <p>How to read and interpret RakNet's statistical data
    <BR>
    <BR>
    
    Statistical data is important for an online game because it lets you see where your traffic bottlenecks are.  To this end, Raknet provides the structure RakNetStatistics which is returned by the GetStatistics() function present in RakPeerInterface.  This structure is defined in <I>Source/RakNetStatistics.h</I>.  The function StatisticsToString is also provided which will convert these statistics to a formatted buffer.<BR>
  <BR>
    Terms used
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>CRC</B> - Cyclic Redundancy Check data used with encrypted messages to detect tampering.<BR>
  <B>Encryption bits</B> - Extra data in the header that is used solely for encryption headers and block alignment required for encryption.<BR>
  <B>Resend queue</B> - A queue of reliable messages waiting for acknowlegements.<BR>
  <B>Split message</B> - A block of data that is a segment of a larger block of data.  The original message is split if it is larger than the MTU when accounting for headers from RakNet and UDP.<BR>
  <B>Message</B> - A block of data to be sent.<BR>
  <B>Packet</B> - A packet contains zero or more acknowlegements and zero or more messages, at least one of either.<BR>

  <I>Description:</I> Number of packets that have been sent that contain only acknowlegements.<BR>
  <I>High values:</I> If this number rises continually, then the sender is flooding the recipient. Could also mean a network spike.<BR>
  <I>Zero value:</I> Normal performance.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned acknowlegementsSent;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of acknowlegements sent for reliable messages.  Each reliable message recieved generates one acknowlegement, including resends.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned acknowlegementsPending;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of acknowlegements waiting to be sent for reliable messages.  Each reliable message recieved generates one acknowlegement, including resends.<BR>

  <I>Description:</I> Number of packets that have been sent that contain only acknowlegements and resends.<BR>
  <I>High values:</I> If this number rises continually then the sender is flooding the recipient at the same time the sender is not acknowleging packets.  This could be poor network performance or could be when traffic is only flowing one way.<BR>
  <I>Low values:</I> Normal performance.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned messageResends;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of messages that were not acknowleged in time so were resent.  This is equivalent to packetloss.<BR>

  <B>unsigned numberOfSplitMessages;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of messages sent that were over the MTU size, including RakNet's and the UDP headers.<BR>

  <I>Description:</I> When using secure connections, the number of packets that didn't pass the CRC check.<BR>
  <I>Non-zero values:</I> This can occur to connection sequence packets arriving late.  If the values rises consistently and rapidly, then someone is modifying packets during transmission.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned bitsReceived;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of bits that have been recieved while the connection is active, excluding bits with a bad CRC if secure connections are used.<BR>

  <BR>
  <B>unsigned acknowlegementsReceived;</B><BR>

  <I>Description:</I> How many acknowlgements we recieved for messages that have already been acknowleged - or were never reliable to begin with.<BR>
  <I>Non-zero values:</I> The sender has high packetloss.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned messagesReceived;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Number of data messages that have arrived.  This is always equal to or greater than the number of packets recieved.  High values indicate good message aggreggation by the sender.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned invalidMessagesReceived;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> How many data messages, other than acknowlgements, we recieved with corrupt internal information.<BR>
  <I>Non-zero values:</I> Packet tampering or an internal send error.<BR>

  <B>unsigned duplicateMessagesReceived;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> How many data messages, other than acknowlgements, we recieved more than once.<BR>
  <I>High values:</I> Acknowlegements are not sent fast enough for the messages received, the sender isn't waiting long enough to resend, or  there's a lot of packetloss.<BR>
  <I>Low values:</I> Normal performance.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned messagesWaitingForReassembly;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> How many split messages are waiting to be completed.<BR>

  <BR>
  <B>unsigned internalOutputQueueSize;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> How many messages are waiting to be passed out of the reliability layer.<BR>
  <I>Non-zero values:</I> The update thread is spending all its time recieving messages and is not updating the reliability layer in a timely fashion.  This could be due to handling too many clients on a slow server.<BR>
  <BR>
    
  <B>double bitsPerSecond;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> Current bandwidth used, in bits per second.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>unsigned long connectionStartTime;</B><BR>
  <I>Description:</I> System time returned by getTime() when the connection was established.</p>
  <p><strong>bool bandwidthExceeded;</strong><BR>
  <em>Description:</em> On the last update cycle, RakNet did not send all the data waiting to go out due to flow control, and under certain conditions will increase the allowed output throughput. This will normally be true for the first 30 seconds of a new connection as the available bandwidth is established. It will be false if you are sending data below current allowed capacity. </p></TD>
